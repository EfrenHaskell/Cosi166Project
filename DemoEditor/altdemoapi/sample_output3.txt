Great question — this is exactly the kind of subtle mistake that happens when you mix up what the instructions are asking with what the code actually does. Let’s go through it.

What’s wrong with your code:

You skipped the function definition.

The instructions asked you to write a function named print_hello_world. Your code just runs print() directly, not inside a function.

The function name is missing.

They specifically wanted a function with that exact name. If you don’t define it, then nothing named print_hello_world exists for Python to call.

Skills to practice:

Defining functions

Get comfortable with def function_name(): ... syntax.

Practice writing functions with and without parameters.

Following instructions literally

Pay attention to exact requirements like function name, what it should print, and whether to return or print.

Practice translating English instructions into Python code.

Understanding scope

Code written inside a function only runs when you call that function. Practice the difference between code that runs immediately and code that runs only when the function is used.

Testing your code

After writing the function, try calling it explicitly (e.g., by its name) to check if it does exactly what was asked.

Would you like me to create a set of small drills where you practice writing tiny functions (like print_hello_world) so you can lock in the pattern?
