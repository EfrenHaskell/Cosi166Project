Got it — I’ll point out what’s wrong without fixing it for you, and then suggest some skills you can practice to avoid these mistakes in the future.

Issues in your code:

Function parameter naming

You’re using reserved words (like int) as parameter names. That’s not allowed in Python.

Parameter names should follow the same rules as variable names.

Syntax of function definitions

The way you’re declaring parameters isn’t valid. Python doesn’t allow you to just repeat types in the parameter list.

Printing parameters

You’re trying to print something that’s shadowing a built-in (int), which will confuse both Python and you.

Skills to practice:

Reserved words and built-ins

Learn which names are reserved in Python (like int, str, def, etc.).

Avoid overwriting built-in types and functions.

Function parameters

Practice writing functions with parameters and return values.

Get comfortable with the difference between type annotations and parameter names.

Naming conventions

Use descriptive variable and parameter names.

Stick to snake_case to keep things readable.

Understanding scope and shadowing

Learn what it means to “shadow” a built-in name (e.g., naming something int hides the real int type).

Practice renaming things to avoid conflicts.

Reading error messages

Try running this code in Python — the error message will point you exactly to the syntax issue, which is a great way to learn.
