Certainly! Based on your code, it seems you've written a statement to print "hello world" directly, rather than encapsulating this functionality within a function. Here are some aspects you might want to focus on:

1. **Function Definition:** Learn how to define a function in Python. This includes understanding the use of the `def` keyword and proper indentation.

2. **Code Encapsulation:** Practice encapsulating code within functions to make it reusable and modular.

3. **Function Naming and Invocation:** Understand how to correctly name a function and call or invoke it after defining it.

4. **Debugging and Testing:** Develop skills to test your code to ensure that it works as expected before considering it complete.

5. **Reading Problem Statements Carefully:** Work on carefully reading and understanding what a problem or assignment is asking you to do, to ensure your solution aligns with the requirements.

Strengthening these skills will help you write more accurate and functional code in the future.
