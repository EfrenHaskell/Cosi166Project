Certainly! I'll help you identify the problems in your code:

1. **Indentation Issues**: In Python, consistent indentation is crucial since it defines the blocks of code. Your code is inconsistently indented; the `print` statement should be properly aligned with the function definition.

2. **Formatting**: Generally, code should be well-formatted to enhance readability. The alignment of your function definition and its body is inconsistent, which could lead to errors in more complex programs.

### Skills to Work On:

1. **Understanding Indentation**: Learn how Python uses indentation to define scope (e.g., in functions, loops). Proper indentation is key in Python.

2. **Code Formatting**: Practice maintaining consistent formatting for readability. Many code editors have auto-format features that can help with this.

3. **Basic Python Syntax**: Reviewing the basics of function definitions and how to structure them will help solidify your understanding.

4. **Debugging**: Develop skills to identify and resolve syntactic errors by carefully reading error messages and understanding the common causes of such errors.

By improving in these areas, you'll be able to avoid similar mistakes in the future.
