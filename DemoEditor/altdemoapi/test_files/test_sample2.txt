Your code seems to be correct if the requirement is to define a function called `print_hello_world` that prints "hello world". However, there might be a misunderstanding in executing or calling the function.

Here are possible areas to check:

1. **Function Call**: You need to call the function for it to execute. If you're not calling `print_hello_world()`, nothing will be printed.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure there are no discrepancies in string casing. Your code uses "hello world", which is correct based on the given requirements, but double-check this matches the precise requirement.

3. **Environment Issues**: Make sure you're executing the script in a Python environment that doesn't suppress output messages, such as certain IDEs or interactive shells.

### Skills to Work On:

1. **Reading Requirements Carefully**: Ensure you pay close attention to task details to avoid small errors.

2. **Debugging Techniques**: Practice identifying where issues are in your code by stepping through it or using debugging tools.

3. **Execution Flow**: Understand how Python scripts execute, and make sure to call functions after defining them.

4. **Testing Your Code**: Learn to test your functions after writing them to confirm they produce the expected output.

5. **Code Environment**: Familiarize yourself with how your development environment works to avoid problems related to environment misconfigurations.
