Got it — I’ll point out what’s wrong without fixing it for you, and then suggest some skills you can practice to avoid these mistakes in the future.

Issues in your code:

String formatting – Your string isn’t properly closed, which will cause a syntax error.

Variable naming rules – Identifiers can’t start with a number, and special characters like ; don’t behave the same in Python as in some other languages.

Function calls – You’re trying to call a function that hasn’t been defined yet.

Skills you can work on:

Python syntax basics

Practice writing strings with correct quotation marks.

Learn when parentheses and colons are required.

Valid variable naming

Review rules: variable names can only use letters, digits (not as the first character), and underscores.

Get comfortable with snake_case naming conventions.

Understanding statements and expressions

Python doesn’t use ; at the end of lines (unlike languages like C++ or Java).

Each line is usually a separate statement.

Functions

Learn how to define your own functions with def.

Understand that you can only call functions after they are defined or imported.

Debugging techniques

Read error messages carefully: Python’s tracebacks are very explicit about what went wrong.

Try running small pieces of code step by step to isolate issues.

Would you like me to also suggest a small set of beginner practice exercises targeted at exactly these skills?
